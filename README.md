## 🏋️ Introduction 

LiftLink is an online forum web application where users can share workouts and view posted workout routines from other users. LiftLink aims to create a community for beginners and seasoned lifters to help one another improve their gym performance. This project is my first ever Hackathon project built at **SpartaHack 9**.

## 💪 Ways to improve application

This application was built in 24 hours at SpartaHack 9, so there is a lot of work to be done on it. As this application is largely a work in progress, here are some future feature ideas:

- **Display user workout data on home page:** Update the home page to display real user and exercise routine data.
- **Interactive workout mode**: Allow users to go through the workout interactively, timing each set as specified in the routine.
- **Weight tracking**: Building on the previous feature, users should be able to track their weight, sets and reps on each workout. Given these inputs, the app should incrementally increase the weight and reps over time to facilitate progressive overload.
- **AI-powered workout generation:** Integrate LangChain and a Large Language Model to generate a workout based on available exercises and desired muscle groups.
- **Exercise tutorials:** Integrate the YouTube API to include video tutorials for each exercise.
